Will they not then believe?\" Quran 21:30. Indeed the universe was one unit. And from water came all of life.</span>\n          <br/> <br/>\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>\"The Romans have been defeated in the neighboring land, but after their defeat they shall gain victory in a few years. All power belongs to Allah both before and after. On that day will the believers rejoice\" Quran 30:1-5. This was an insane prediction to make for someone claiming to be a Prophet. The Byzantines suffered a severe crippling series of losses by the Persians, it was nearly hopeless. Yet they triumphed, and near that day the Muslims also triumped vs. the Meccan pagans.</span>\n          <br/> <br/>\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>The Quran, a 'recitation' memorized by hundreds of people at the time, was compiled into book form to perfection. If any verse or chapter was missing, there would have been hundreds of reciters pointing to any omissions or insertions. Recently a 'checksum' was discovered, which verifies the Quran's preservation.  If you add the chapter number to verse number, for each chapter. If you take the odd chapters results and sum them, they turn out to be equal to the sum of the chapter numbers of the quran. If you take the even chapter results and sum them, they turn out to be equal to total number of verses in quran. \"Indeed We have sent down the Reminder, and indeed We will preserve it.\" Quran 15:9 *mathmatical miracle*</span>\n          <br/> <br/>\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>\"And it is thus that We appointed you to be the community of the middle way so that you might be witnesses to all mankind\" Quran 2:143. This verse describing 'the middle way', was found directly in the middle of the chapter which consisted of 286 verses.</span>\n          <br/> <br />\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>Whenever Moses has dialogue with the Israelites he refers to them as 'My nation'. Whenever Jesus speaks to the Israelites he refers to them as 'Sons of Israel'. The Quran remains consistent with history. Jesus never had a father, and so his father wasn't among that nation. They would refer to each other based on their father's names. So he could never refer to them as 'My nation'.</span>\n          <br/> <br />\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>The Quran's middle chapter is titled 'The Iron'. Corrlates with the center of our Earth, which consists of only iron and nickel.</span>\n          <br/> <br />\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>The Quran has a chapter which predicts Prophet Muhammad's half paternal uncle would never convert. This uncle would constantly follow the Prophet and try to negate anything he said on the spot, like a pest. All he had to do to disprove Islam was to fake his conversion. Yet he didn't the rest of his life despite knowing this verse.</span>\n          <br/> <br />\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>A very interesting hidden prediction/record of the Prophet's death. There is one unique word (Natawafayanak = \"We take you in death\"), used only three times referring to the Prophet's oncoming death. It is used in chapters 40, 10, and 13. The Prophet spent 40 years living before Prophethood. Then 10 years in Mecca. And 13 years in Medina before finally dying. Adding 10, 13, and 40, sum to the age of 63, which was his age of death. </span>\n          <br/> <br />\n          Many more to come!\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"bgimg-2\"></div>\n\n      <div className=\"content-wrapper\">\n        <div className=\"content\">\n          <h1> Hadith signs <br/>(Prophet Muhammad's divinely revealed knowledge) </h1>\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span>\"The Last Hour will not come before wealth becomes abundant and overflowing, so much so that a man takes Zakat out of his property and cannot find anyone to accept it from him and till the land of Arabia reverts to meadows and rivers.\" This prophecy is almost insane to make. Nowhere in Arab tradition did anybody believe that Arabia used to be forests with rivers. RIVERS! FORESTS! And that it would return to transforming into forests sometime before the day of judgment! It was only recently discovered that Arabia changes climate every 23,000 years. Even the Sahara used to be a jungle. Perhaps with climate change, people will be forced to turn deserts into green land to combat global warming. Something inittated by Allan Savory already.</span>\n          <br/><br/>\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span> A prophecy that Lake Tiberius/Galilee will dry up, and that this will signal the coming of Dajjal (The great deceiver/anti christ). Israel is predicted to receive between 15%-25% less rainfall over the next century due to climate change and it is already having major issues with the usage of Lake Tiberius it had to cut off most usage to it and instead use other water sources.</span>\n          <br/><br/>\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span> A prophecy that the Euphrates river will dry up, revealing a mountain of gold, and most of the people who try to get that gold will die for it. https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=102184336 It seems that it is partially coming true. The Euphrates is the lowest it's ever been, fisherman can't even find fish in there anymore. And jewels, coins, documents, and ancient artifacts super valuable to archaeologists to their surprise are showing up.</span>\n          <br/><br/>\n          <img width=\"25px\" src={starlink} /> <span> A prophecy that one day, things we wear like shoes, or the area on our thighs will speak to us, and tell us of things happening back at home.
